# 🚀 Introduction

📺 **Talkn** is a Web3 video streaming app. The decentralized app allows users to host their videos on the Blockchain and deal with them using CryptoCurrency. The app holders can gain profits from Talkn by cutting a percentage of the blockchain transactions running on this app for themselves. It's built on the BNB Blockchain and supports MetaMask wallet.

The app was built with an approach to simplify the end user experience of the Web3 apps. It is running perfectly on all viewports; the end user will not suffer from the usual hassles of the Web3 apps. As a user, no need to go through complicated steps to be a part of this app.

# 🌐 Overview

**TALKN** - Posting, Engaging, and Talking has never been so rewarding! 💬

Energized by your desires and the latest Web3 innovations, Talkn is powering a social web3 revolution — and you're part of it.

## 🔨 HOW TALKN WAS BUILT AND ITS GOALS:

The whole day we're talking, posting, and scrolling on social media without earning a single $, the majority of us use social platforms for engaging their lives, but we didn't concern that most of our time is vested and we didn't do or gain anything (Followers, money, etc.). Then we say that we will do it tomorrow, as for perspective our routine will change. Now let's imagine that your talking & scrolling will give you money "Save time + Chill Vibes = Earn money" 💸, Talkn wants to envision itself as a community platform. We are the first team to create and implement a sustainable, working Talk-to-Earn (T2E) model.

## 🌟 The Platform For Talk and Engage In Web3:

**TALKN** is the first-ever idea in web3.0 to convert your voice into crypto (CYVIC). By simply Live Streaming, Posting Content, Engaging, and Interacting with other users through our social web3 platform, or participating in our ecosystem activities, users will earn ($TLKN), the native token of Talkn.

TALKN's capability intends to incentivize fifty (50) million people around the globe towards a web3 lifestyle, introducing them to how revolutionary the web3 can and will be, all while relying on its social elements and simple UI to develop a long-lasting platform encouraging user-generated Web 3.0 content.

To Build an overall social Web3 infrastructure with advanced and good experience via Talkn.

# ✅ What we've done

First and foremost, our platform now follows the subscription-based video-on-demand (SVOD) model made popular by Netflix. This means that users can now create their own channels with their own subscription prices and upload videos to this channel. Users have the option to make their videos either free or premium, with premium videos requiring a channel subscription.

In addition, we have introduced an affiliate program that allows users to generate referral codes and send them to others. The code owner and the buyer both receive a profit, which helps market the platform itself.

We have also made a big change in terms of storage, by implementing IPFS as a decentralized storage solution.
